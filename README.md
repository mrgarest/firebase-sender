# Laravel Firebase Sender

Laravel library for sending notifications with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

_If you have previously used the old version of v2, you should read the instructions for [migrating to v3](https://github.com/mrgarest/firebase-sender/blob/master/migrating-to-v3.md)._

⚠️ **IMPORTANT UPDATE**: This package has been renamed from `mrgarest/laravel-firebase-sender` to `garest/firebase-sender`.

### Supported platforms

| ✅  | Platform  |
| --- | -------- |
| ✅  | Apns     |
| ✅  | Android  |
| ✅  | WebPush  |

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```
composer require garest/firebase-sender
```

## Configuration

After installing the package, you will need to publish the configuration file `firebase-sender.php`

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=firebase-sender-config
```

After publishing the configuration file, you need to open it and add the Service account data from the Firebase console.

_If you don't know how to get a Service account, here is a [video from YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBiLIw2KnY)._

## Usage

`FirebaseSender` is a class that is responsible for sending notification to devices via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) using a service account with Firebase.

```php
$firebaseSender = new FirebaseSender('MY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME');
```

`MY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME` - the identifier of your service account registered in the `firebase-sender.php` configuration.

### Send a notification to a specific device

To send a notification directly to the device, use the `setDeviceToken` method, passing in a unique device token generated by Firebase.

```php
$firebaseSender->setDeviceToken('DEVICE_TOKEN');
```

_Note that you can use either `setDeviceToken` or `setTopic`. You cannot use both methods._

### Send a notification on a specific topic

To send a notification to all devices subscribed to a specific topic, use the setTopic() method, passing the topic name as a string:

```php
$firebaseSender->setTopic('TOPIC_NAME');
```

#### Topic conditions

The TopicCondition class allows you to create complex logical conditions for determining the topics to which a notification will be sent.

To send a notification to a combination of topics, you need to build a boolean expression that describes the target topics. The expression can contain the AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators, as well as grouping using parentheses.

For example, to send a notification to devices subscribed to `topicA` and (`topicB` or `topicC`), you can build the following expression:

```php
$firebaseSender->setTopic(TopicCondition::make()
    ->topic('topicA')
    ->and()
    ->group(fn($group) => $group->topic('topicB')->or()->topic('topicC'))
);
```

### Set notifications

The `setNotification` method allows you to set the main content of the notification that will be sent through Firebase.

```php
$firebaseSender->setNotification(new NotificationPush(
    title: 'TITLE',
    body: 'BODY'
));
```

### Set notifications for Android

The `setAndroid` method allows you to set the notification content for Android devices.

```php
$firebaseSender->setAndroid(new AndroidPush(
    title: 'TITLE',
    body: 'BODY'
));
```

### Set notifications for APNs

The `setApns` method allows you to set the notification content for APNs (Apple Push Notification Service).

```php
$firebaseSender->setApns(new ApnsPush(
    title: 'TITLE',
    body: 'BODY'
));
```

### Send a notification

After configuring the notification, you can send it by calling the `send` method.

```php
$firebaseSender->send(): SendReport
```

If you don't want to send the message immediately, but want to schedule it for later, you can use the `sendJob` method. To use this method, [queues](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/queues) must be configured in your Laravel project.

```php
$firebaseSender->sendJob(Carbon $scheduledAt, int $chunkLength = 10, int $maxRand = 0): void
```

This method takes one required value and two optional values.

| Value          | Type     | Required | Description                                                    |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$scheduledAt` | `Carbon` | Yes      | Date when notification should be sent                          |
| `$chunkLength` | `int`    | No       | Allows you to split messages into chunks                       |
| `$maxRand`     | `int`    | No       | Adds a random number of seconds to the chunk dispatch schedule |

### Clear

When you need to send new notifications, you can simply clear the previously sent data without having to re-announce the class.

```php
$firebaseSender->clear(): void
```

### Grouping

Using the `setGroup` grouping method, you can send multiple messages at once by combining messages into groups.

```php
$firebaseSender->setGroup(int $index): void
```

Each group must have its own index, recipient, and message body.

Example of sending group notifications:
```php
$firebaseSender = new FirebaseSender('MY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME');

$firebaseSender->setGroup(0);
$firebaseSender->setDeviceToken("MY_DEVICE_TOKEN_1");
$firebaseSender->setNotification(new NotificationPush(
    title: "Lorem ipsum",
    body: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.',
));

$firebaseSender->setGroup(1);
$firebaseSender->setDeviceToken("MY_DEVICE_TOKEN_2");
$firebaseSender->setNotification(new NotificationPush(
    title: "Lorem ipsum",
    body: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.',
));

$firebaseSender->send();
```

### Custom messages

With this method, you can specify a custom data structure for the messages to be sent through FCM. This can be useful for sending additional information that is not included in the standard notification options.

```php
$firebaseSender->setMessages([
    [
        'token' => 'DEVICE_TOKEN',
        'notification' => [
            'title' => 'TITLE',
            'body' => 'BODY'
        ]
    ]
]);
```

_When using `setMessages`, the `setNotification`, `setAndroid` and `setApns` methods will not work._


## Localized notifications

`AndroidPush` and `ApnsPush` support sending localized notifications, which allows you to dynamically display text depending on the user's language.

To do this, use the `titleLocKey` and `bodyLocKey` parameters, which specify the keys to localized strings in your application's resources.

You can also specify the `titleLocArgs` and `bodyLocArgs` parameters, which can be used to pass values that will be inserted into localized notification templates.

## Notification log

If you want to use the log of sent notifications, you will also need to publish the migration file and perform the migration.

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=firebase-sender-migrations
```

```
php artisan make:migration
```

To store information about sent notifications in the database, you can enable the event log.

```php
$firebaseSender->logEnabled(bool $enabled = true): void
```

The event log also supports two additional methods for adding payloads to the log.


```php
$firebaseSender->setPayload1(?string $payload = null): void
$firebaseSender->setPayload2(?string $payload = null): void
```

### FirebaseSenderLog Query Scopes

#### messageId

Filter logs by the message ID.

```php
$query->messageId(45543643);
```

#### serviceAccount

Filter logs by the service account used to send the notification.

```php
$query->serviceAccount('MY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME');
```

#### deviceToken

Filter logs by the device token (for notifications sent to a specific device).

```php
$query->deviceToken('DEVICE_TOKEN');
```

#### Topic

Filters records where the topic exactly matches the value passed.

```php
$query->topic('TOPIC_NAME');
```

If you need to search for a topic that may appear as part of a condition, use the `matchTopic` method. It allows matching both exact topics and topics used in conditions.

```php
$query->matchTopic('TOPIC_NAME');
```

By default, `matchTopic` checks for both exact and conditional matches. If you want to search only within conditions, pass true as the second argument:

```php
$query->matchTopic(
    'TOPIC_NAME',
    true
);
```

#### Payload

`payload1` and `payload2` filter logs by the first value of the user payload.

```php
$query->payload1('language');
```

#### createdBetween

Filter logs created between two dates.

```php
$query->createdBetween(
    Carbon::now(),
    Carbon::now()->subHours(1)
);
```

#### sentBetween

Filter logs where the notification was sent between two dates.

```php
$query->sentBetween(
    Carbon::now(),
    Carbon::now()->subHours(1)
);
```

#### scheduledBetween

Filter logs where the notification was scheduled between two dates.

```php
$query->scheduledBetween(
    Carbon::now(),
    Carbon::now()->subHours(1)
);
```

#### failedBetween

Filter logs where the notification failed between two dates.

```php
$query->failedBetween(
    Carbon::now(),
    Carbon::now()->subHours(1)
);
```
