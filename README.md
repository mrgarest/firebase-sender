# Laravel Firebase Sender

Laravel library for sending notifications with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

❗️ **This library only works with the new FCM HTTP v1 API** ❗️

_If you have previously used the old version of v1, you should read the instructions for [migrating to v2](https://github.com/mrgarest/laravel-firebase-sender/blob/master/migrating-to-v2.md)._

### Supported platforms

| ✅  | Platform |
| --- | -------- |
| ✅  | Apns     |
| ✅  | Android  |
| ✅  | WebPush  |

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```
composer require mrgarest/laravel-firebase-sender
```

## Configuration

After installing the package, you will need to publish the configuration file `firebase-sender.php`

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=firebase-sender-config
```

After publishing the configuration file, you need to open it and add the Service account data from the Firebase console.

_If you don't know how to get a Service account, here is a [video from YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBiLIw2KnY)._

## Usage

`FirebaseSender` is a class that is responsible for sending notification to devices via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) using a service account with Firebase.

```php
$firebaseSender = new FirebaseSender('MY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME');
```

`MY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME` - the identifier of your service account registered in the firebase-sender.php configuration

### Send a notification to a specific device

To send a notification directly to the device, use the `setDeviceToken()` method, passing in a unique device token generated by Firebase.

```php
$firebaseSender->setDeviceToken('DEVICE_TOKEN');
```

_Note that you can use either `setDeviceToken()` or `setTopic()`. You cannot use both methods._

### Send a notification on a specific topic

To send a notification to all devices subscribed to a specific topic, use the setTopic() method, passing the topic name as a string:

```php
$firebaseSender->setTopic('TOPIC_NAME')
```

#### Topic conditions

The TopicCondition class allows you to create complex logical conditions for determining the topics to which a notification will be sent.

To send a notification to a combination of topics, you need to build a boolean expression that describes the target topics. The expression can contain the AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators, as well as grouping using parentheses.

For example, to send a notification to devices subscribed to `topicA` and (`topicB` or `topicC`), you can build the following expression:

```php
$firebaseSender->setTopic(TopicCondition::make()
    ->topic('topicA')
    ->and()
    ->group(fn($group) => $group->topic('topicB')->or()->topic('topicC'))
);
```

### Set notifications

The `setNotification()` method allows you to set the main content of the notification that will be sent through Firebase.

```php
$firebaseSender->setNotification(new NotificationPush(
    title: 'TITLE',
    body: 'BODY'
));
```

### Set notifications for Android

The `setAndroid()` method allows you to set the notification content for Android devices.

```php
$firebaseSender->setAndroid(new AndroidPush(
    title: 'TITLE',
    body: 'BODY'
));
```

### Set notifications for APNs

The `setApns()` method allows you to set the notification content for APNs (Apple Push Notification Service).

```php
$firebaseSender->setApns(new ApnsPush(
    title: 'TITLE',
    body: 'BODY'
));
```

### Send a notification

After configuring the notification, you can send it by calling the `send()` method.

```php
$firebaseSender->send();
```

### Custom message

With this method, you can specify a custom data structure for the message to be sent through FCM. This can be useful for sending additional information that is not included in the standard notification options.

```php
$firebaseSender->setMessage([
    'token' => 'DEVICE_TOKEN',
    'notification' => [
        'title' => 'TITLE',
        'body' => 'BODY'
    ]
]);
```

_When using `setMessage()`, the `setNotification()`, `setAndroid()` and `setApns()` methods will not work._

## Auth Token

In some cases, you may need an Auth Token for Firebase, and it can be obtained separately without sending any notifications using the `getAuthToken()` method.

```php
$auth = $firebaseSender->getAuthToken();
```

Example of a successful response:

```php
[
  "access_token" => "access_token"
  "expires_in" => 3599
  "token_type" => "Bearer"
]
```

## Localized notifications

`AndroidPush` and `ApnsPush` support sending localized notifications, which allows you to dynamically display text depending on the user's language.

To do this, use the `titleLocKey` and `bodyLocKey` parameters, which specify the keys to localized strings in your application's resources.

You can also specify the `titleLocArgs` and `bodyLocArgs` parameters, which can be used to pass values that will be inserted into localized notification templates.

## Notification log

If you want to use the log of sent notifications, you will also need to publish the migration file and perform the migration.

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=firebase-sender-migrations
```

```
php artisan make:migration
```

To add notification information to the log, you'll need to use an additional method before sending notifications:

```php
$firebaseSender->setDatabaseLog();
```

This method can also take an additional value of type string, which can be used, for example, to check whether a notification was sent with a specific argument to avoid duplicate notifications.

```php
$firebaseSender->setDatabaseLog('TEST_VALUE');
```

To check if there is an additional value in the log, you can use this method:

```php
$isValue = FirebaseSenderLog::isValue('TEST_VALUE', 'MY_TOPIC');
```

You can also check the additional value by date range:

```php
$isValue = FirebaseSenderLog::isValueByTimeRange(Carbon::now()->subMinutes(30), 'TEST_VALUE', 'MY_TOPIC');
```

You can also check if notifications were sent within a specific time range:

```php
$isValue = FirebaseSenderLog::isToByTimeRange(Carbon::now()->subMinutes(30), 'MY_TOPIC');
```
